  Help split a long-form article into sequential social media posts. Proposes the
  post-by-post sequence as TODO PROPOSAL and marks adaptation needs as TODO —
  never writes the posts themselves. Examples: "help me split this into social
  posts", "break this long-form into a post series", "plan a 5-post sequence".

# Writing Split

Help the author split a long-form article into sequential social media posts. The posts are the author's prose — this skill only structures the split.

## When to Use

- The author asks to split a long-form piece into social posts
- Planning a sequential post series from one article

## When NOT to Use

- General developmental editing → `yoker_writing_assistant:writing-review`
- Continuity across existing parts → `yoker_writing_assistant:writing-continuity`

## Practices

| Practice | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Identify break points | Find natural seams in the long-form piece. |
| Propose the sequence | As `TODO PROPOSAL:` — a post-by-post outline, never the posts themselves. |
| Mark adaptations | Parts that need rework for a standalone post are marked `TODO:`. |
| Never write the posts | The posts are the author's prose. Only structure the split. |
| Dual-audience lens | Help each part work both as a standalone post and as a chapter of the whole. |

## Rules

- **Never write the posts.** The sequence is an outline (`TODO PROPOSAL:`); the prose is the author's.
- **Mark rework, don't do it.** Anything needing adaptation for a standalone post is a `TODO:` for the author.
- **Locate precisely.** Tie each proposed post to the source section/paragraph range it draws from.
- **End with "What this did NOT check."** Note what was out of scope (e.g., "did not assess each post's voice — that is yoker_writing_assistant:writing-voice").

## Local Guardrail

This skill proposes structure only — a post sequence as `TODO PROPOSAL:` and adaptation needs as `TODO:`. It never writes the posts, never authors prose, and never rewrites the author's text. If invoked standalone, the same rule applies.
